          This website is kind of a mess on the backend right now and I don't
          really want to remake the website for an 8th time (literally - this is
          v7 of the website).

          Anyways, hi! I'm Quinn and I like to build stuff? I guess.. I don't
          know - I can code and stuff and I can 3d model and build things. I
          basically do whatever I feel like doing, and usually that leads to
          cool things because when you do something 300 times, you get good at
          it. (I have over 300 coding projects that I have done...)
        </p>
        <p style={{ lineHeight: "1.5rem" }}>
          At least when I'm writing this, I would bet that you came here because
          you saw the Berlin Airlift thing - I've been coding that for like 3
          hours, and it's really the first time I've coded for so long in a
          while. I don't know what the point of me writing this is... But if
          you're reading this I guess that's cool
        </p>
        <p style={{ lineHeight: "1.5rem" }}>
          I think I've written enough - bye, have good day!
